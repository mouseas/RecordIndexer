Students,

For the data importer to behave correctly with the passoff driver, your database must be empty before importing data. The currentbuild.xml file can handle this for you as long as you put the database your server uses and an empty version of that database in the correct places. You may do this or change the build.xml file and create an empty version of your database in your own way.

Before running the data importer, the current build.xml file creates an empty database on line 86 when it copies an empty database over the normal database. For your data importer to work correctly with the build.xml file as it is now you must:

    Put the database your server uses under [your project directory]/database/indexer_server.sqlite
    Put an empty version of your database (with all the correct tables, just no data) under [your project directory]/database/indexer_server_empty.sqlite

You are also free to delete line 86 from build.xml and create an empty version of your database in your own way.

Let us know if you have any questions,

Derek
